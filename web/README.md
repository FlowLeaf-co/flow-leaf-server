# Flask Web Application

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Tests

    python -u manage.py test

## Database Migrations

For a database migration, the web app has to be started outside Docker (the database may run in Docker). First make sure the database is up-to-date:

    python manage.py db upgrade

Then, to create a new migration use:

    python manage.py db migrate

This will create a diff from the previous database in migrations/versions.

## Options

To start the web server with a custom port and host binding:

    python -u manage.py runserver -p 8001 -h 0.0.0.0

## Recommended Development Process

The secret configuration differs when using local and Docker configurations.
